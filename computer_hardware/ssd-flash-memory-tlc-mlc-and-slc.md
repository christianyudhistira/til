# SSD Flash Memory - TLC, MLC and SLC

3 SSD flash storage options:    
1. **SLC - Single Level Cell**  
Storing 1 bit per cell. Read/write life cycles are expected between 20,000 and 30,000 cycles per cell.
2. **MLC - Multi Level Cell**   
storing multi bits (usually 2 bits) per cell. Read/write life cycles are less in comparison to SLC at around 10,000 per cell.
3. **TLC - Triple Level Cell**  
Storing 3 bits per cell. Read/write life cycles are considerably shorter at 3,000 to 5,000 cycles per cell.
